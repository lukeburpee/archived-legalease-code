 * <li> {@link #processDocument(BufferedReader) processDocument} will be called
 *      one or more times with the text of the corpus.
 *
 * <li> {@link #processSpace(Properties) processSpace} will be called after all
 *      the documents have been used.  Once this method has been called, no
 *      further calls to {@code processDocument} should be made
 *
 * <li> {@link #getVector(String) getVector} may be called after the space has
 *      been processed.  Implementations may optionally support this method
 *      being called prior to {@code processSpace} but this is not required.
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * In addition, {@link #getWords()} may be called at any time to determine which
 * words are currently represented in the space.  Implementations should specify
 * in their class documentations what parameters are available as properties for
 * the {@code processSpace} method, and what the default value of those
 * parameters are.
